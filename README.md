# SpaceX Viewer

## Task:

Create a launches viewer for "SpaceX" using the existing public Rest API (https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/README.md).
Launches must be shown in a Pinterest-like grid (with any image of launch or youtube preview as a thumbnail) where the recent launches are always above the older ones.
The grid must use the infinite scroll approach to load older launches.
Launches can be filtered by any 2 criteria (you can choose) and 1 required filter is by rocket name.
Total - 3 filters. Click on launch thumbnail must open a popup with launch details.
Required Technologies: TypeScript, React, React Hooks, Emotion/Styled-Components/Stitches, Axios.
Please, upload your solution to GitHub repository
